## Project Reflection

### Technical Journey and Challenges
My experience with the Event Manager API project has been transformative, particularly in understanding modern web application architecture. The most significant challenge was debugging the user registration system, which required deep diving into FastAPI's request handling and SQLAlchemy's database operations. I learned to effectively use logging and debugging tools to trace issues through multiple layers of the application. Working with Docker containers taught me the importance of consistent development environments and proper configuration management.

### Collaboration and Version Control
This project highlighted the critical role of proper Git workflow in team development. I learned to maintain clean commit histories, create meaningful branch names, and write detailed pull request descriptions. The experience of resolving merge conflicts and addressing code review feedback has made me more confident in collaborative development. Using GitHub's issue tracking system helped me organize my work and maintain clear documentation of problems and solutions.

### Growth and Insights
The project significantly enhanced my skills in test-driven development, API design, and system architecture. I gained practical experience with authentication systems, email integration, and database migrations. Most importantly, I learned to approach complex problems methodically - breaking them down into manageable components and implementing systematic solutions. This project has given me valuable experience in real-world software development practices and improved my ability to write maintainable, well-tested code.
