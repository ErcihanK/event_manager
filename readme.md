# Event Manager API Project

## Completed Issues and Solutions
1. [Internal Server Error Fix #1](https://github.com/ErcihanK/event_manager/issues/1)
   When I first encountered this issue, I discovered that the user registration system was failing due to database initialization problems. After careful debugging and analysis, I implemented proper error handling and database connection management.

2. [User Registration Flow Fix #2](https://github.com/ErcihanK/event_manager/issues/2)
   This was particularly challenging as it involved multiple components - from template rendering to email verification. I rebuilt the registration flow to ensure proper user feedback and error handling.

3. [Authentication System Enhancement #3](https://github.com/ErcihanK/event_manager/issues/3)
   Security was a key concern here. I improved the authentication system by implementing proper token validation and password security measures.

## Project Reflection

Coming into this project, I honestly felt a bit overwhelmed. The codebase was complex, using technologies I wasn't entirely familiar with. However, this challenge turned into an incredible learning opportunity. My first major hurdle was understanding how FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL worked together. I spent hours debugging database connection issues, but each problem I solved taught me something valuable about web application architecture.

The most rewarding part was mastering Git and GitHub workflows. Before this project, I had basic Git knowledge, but now I can confidently manage branches, resolve merge conflicts, and create meaningful pull requests. I learned that good commit messages and proper documentation are just as important as the code itself. Working with Docker was another eye-opener - it showed me how crucial it is to have consistent development environments.

What really stands out from this experience is how much I've grown as a developer. I'm no longer intimidated by complex error messages or large codebases. I've learned to break down problems methodically, write comprehensive tests, and think about security from the ground up. The project has given me practical experience with modern development tools and best practices, and I feel much more prepared for real-world software development challenges.
